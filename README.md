## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I grew more familiar using CSS Grid! I had to take a break mid-project to review some tutorials on it which added to my project time. Overall, excluding the 30min tutorial time, it took about an hour and forty minutes to complete this challenge.

### Useful resources

- [relative and absolute position](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H04P5YXVssE) - This tutorial taught me more on how to use absolute and relative position properties.
